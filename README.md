# Blog Web App
This web app allows you to list, create and delete your posts

This project has been developed to practice my skills with React, Redux and React Router.

###Getting Started###

Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start webpack server with the following:

```
	> git clone https://github.com/debiasej/react-redux-blog-app.git
	> cd react-redux-blog-app
	> npm install
	> npm start
```
This is an example created in the Stephen Grider's course: [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) that have been modified by me.
